    <p>Taylor Swift is my favorite artist of all time!</p>

  <p>Since I'm just learning how to code, I thought I'd focus my homework assignment this week on building a fan page around Taylor Swift. Check out my page, and hopefully you can give her music a listen!</p>

  <h2 id="Life Story">Life Story</h2>

  <p>Taylor Swift is a singer-songwriter, dancer, and sometimes actress. Much of her songwriting is inspired from her personal life, and she was widely good at her craft even at her breakout age of 14. She started her career singing and writing country music songs back in 2004 and transitioned gradually to country pop with her albums Fearless in 2008 and Speak Now in 2010. At seventeen years old, winning her first VMA award, infamous Kanye West stole the mic from her and disrespected Swift on a national stage.</p>

  <p>She struggled against this incidence, trying desperately to avoid this becoming a feud, Swift took to her pen to write more heartfelt and intimate music.</p>

  <p>Her album Red in 2012 allowed her to experiment with other music genres such as rock and electronic. By the time 1989 was released in 2014, she had moved fully away from the country genre into full synth-pop territory.</p>

  <p>Resurfacing, Kanye West dropped a new album, on it he called Taylor Swift out of her name, rapping that he made her famous, essentially taking credit for all her widespread mainstream success. Swift vehemently said she never consented to the wording where Kanye raps about her derogatorily.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Kanye’s wife Kim Kardashian had recorded a conversation where Swift could be heard giving Kanye West permission to use her name in his new song. Kim Kardashian leaked the conversation, and major backlash against Swift followed suit, resulting in Swift going MIA for the next year. She later would say she felt everyone wanted her to disappear.</p>

  <p>She has spoken on how she had become accustomed to viewing her self-worth through external applause and approval. Not having this forced her to re-evaluate her belief system and self-worth. She definitely would come out on top, meeting and falling in love with her fiancé Joe Alwyn during this time.</p>

  <p>In 2017, Reputation burst on the scene with a bang! The world lost their mind, and she sold over a million copies that first week. Lover released in 2019 and gave voice to her newfound confidence and political outspokenness. She sang about love and inclusivity, and oppression and gender roles. She caused a stir. President Donald Trump even came out saying he now like her music 25% less now. Taylor couldn’t care less. No one, including her, would silence her voice again.</p>

  <p>The years between those two albums would be defining for Swift. She was sexually assaulted by a DJ at an event and would spend countess hours in court after he sued her for millions saying she falsely accused him. She countersued for $1, and she won. But having people doubt she was assaulted, having people ask why she put herself in that position, didn’t shout in the moment, didn’t react a certain way, etc, had her feeling small and alone. Then her record label sold off the rights to her music without ever giving her a chance to buy them herself. She ended up rerecording her early albums with a new contract with a new record label to gain the rights to her songs. Lover was the first album released where she owned her music.</p>

  <p>Over the first year of the pandemic, Swift again reinvented herself, delving into folk, indie, and alternative music styles.</p>
